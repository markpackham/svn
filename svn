Version control code learnt from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2034/what-do-the-result-codes-in-svn-mean

    U: Working file was updated

    G: Changes on the repo were automatically merged into the working copy

    M: Working copy is modified

    C: This file conflicts with the version in the repo

    ?: This file is not under version control

    !: This file is under version control but is missing or incomplete

    A: This file will be added to version control (after commit)

    A+: This file will be moved (after commit)

    D: This file will be deleted (after commit)

    S: This signifies that the file or directory has been switched from the path of the rest of the working copy (using svn switch) to a branch

    I: Ignored

    X: External definition

    ~: Type changed

    R: Item has been replaced in your working copy. This means the file was scheduled for deletion, and then a new file with the same name was scheduled for addition in its place.

    L : Item is locked

    E: Item existed, as it would have been created, by an svn update.
